# rodi-js
A Gateway for RoDI in javascript
Based on https://github.com/humitos/rodi-py

## Install
For install just clone the repository and execute in a http server if you want to see the demo.
Don't forget change your Wifi Network to RoDI.

I use a python module called `SimpleHTPPServer` to run the server

```
  python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
